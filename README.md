# Processing.Exp2

- In this project I used Procesing to listen to audio from a mic and create a series of bubbles.
- The colors of the bubbles are random.   

I split the audio into multiple audio bins,   
the sizes and positions of the bubbles depend on random maximum audio amplitudes.  

This means, the visualizations are different each time and with each song.
